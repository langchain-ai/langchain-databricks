"""
This file contains the integration test for DatabricksVectorSearch class.

We run the integration tests nightly by the trusted CI/CD system defined in
a private repository, in order to securely run the tests. With this design,
integration test is not intended to be run manually by OSS contributors.
If you want to update the DatabricksVectorSearch implementation and you think
that you need to update the corresponding integration test, please contact to
the maintainers of the repository to verify the changes.
